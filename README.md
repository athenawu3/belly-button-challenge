# Belly Button Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, I created a dashboard that displays data on the microbial species that are present in individuals' belly buttons. 

You can find my code in static/js/app.js.

You can visit the application site here: https://athenawu3.github.io/belly-button-challenge/. Select a Test Subject ID Number to see the data for an individual sample.

### Demographic Info
The first panel you'll notice on this application is "Demographic Info" in the top left. This shows the individual's demographic info, including ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and wash frequency.

### Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
The chart to the right displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in that individual's belly button, and the number of bacteria in each one. If you hover over it, you can see the OTU labels. 

### Bacteria Cultures per Sample
The bottom chart displays the size of all bacteria cultures for that individual. The size is based on the number of bacteria.
